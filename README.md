# Peter's Version of Video Object Recognition

1. Clone the repo into your local drive
2. Download yolo.weights from pjreddie site 
```
wget http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo.weights
```
3. Get the video that you want to analysize (ideally down-size it if you want to do it quickly)
4. run the following code
```
./darknet detector demo cfg/coco.data cfg/yolo.cfg yolo.weights "YOUR_VIDEO_FILE_HERE"
```
